This is a _living_ version of the legendary Real World Haskell book by the
Three Immortals.

Their contribution to the Haskell ecosystem will forever remain unparalleled,
not only with regard to writing this book, but also in the industrial
application of the Haskell Programming Language -- breaking the boundaries that
had largely come to be set in academia alone. Since then, the community has
steadily been gathering to the point that now we have the Haskell Foundation to
direct its progress.

It is clear that The Three wanted to bring this phenomenal langauge to
mainstream industry in order to save themselves (and the rest of the world) from
the toil of working with non-functional programming languages.

The Haskell ecosystem has come a long way since this book was
published, and moreover, the march of our beloved Haskellers towards
programming-language-nirvana is relentless. This book shall join the party!
